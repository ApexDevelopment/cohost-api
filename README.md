# cohost-api

An unofficial API wrapper for cohost.org that uses tRPC.

cohost-api is in very early development!

## Reasons not to use this (yet)

- The Cohost tRPC API is undocumented and not meant for public use.
- The Cohost tRPC API can change at any time and break this package.
- This package is in flux and breaking changes will happen all the time until it is stable.
